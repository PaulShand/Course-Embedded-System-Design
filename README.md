# Embedded System Design Course - Labs Overview

## Coursework Summary
This series of labs focuses on hands-on experience with embedded system design, specifically using the PSoC 6 CY8CPROTO-063-BLE Prototyping Kit and Arduino Nano 33 BLE. The labs progress from basic familiarity with hardware and software to more complex applications involving communication protocols and external hardware integration.

## Lab Descriptions

### Lab 1: Introduction to PSoC 6
- **Objective**: Gain basic familiarity with the PSoC 6 CY8CPROTO-063-BLE Prototyping Kit and the Modus Toolbox IDE.
- **Tasks**: Write programs to control the PSoC 6â€™s internal LEDs, demonstrating basic digital pin control and voltage setting.

### Lab 2: External Input Systems on PSoC 6
- **Objective**: Develop systems on the PSoC 6 that respond to external inputs.
- **Approach**: Utilize additional hardware components of the PSoC 6, moving beyond step-by-step instructions to more independent, investigation-based learning.

### Lab 3: I2C Protocol with PSoC 6
- **Objective**: Understand and use the I2C protocol for connecting multiple digital devices in embedded systems.
- **Focus**: Build upon the knowledge and hardware used in Lab 2, emphasizing the application of the I2C communication protocol.

### Lab 4: Distance and Speed Estimation with BLE
- **Objective**: Implement a system to estimate the distance and speed of nearby objects, and make this data available over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
- **Tools**: Use additional external hardware components integrated with the PSoC 6.
- **Application**: Enable querying of distance and speed metrics from computers, phones, and tablets via BLE.

### Lab 5: Exploring Arduino Nano 33 BLE
- **Objective**: Gain experience with the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Microcontroller Development Kit.
- **Note**: This lab does not involve the PSoC 6.
- **Requirement**: As always, credit any code sources used as a basis for lab submissions.
